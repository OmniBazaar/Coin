## Key Observations

- **Business logic flaws dominate by frequency** (~22%) but vary widely in impact ($3K to $200M)
- **Access control + bridge exploits dominate by dollar loss** — top 5 alone exceed $1.5B
- **Price manipulation is the most consistent vector** — present every year since 2020
- **Reentrancy remains dangerous despite awareness** — Curve's $69M in 2023 came from a Vyper compiler bug
- **Precision/rounding errors have growing impact** — Balancer $128M (2025), KyberSwap $48M (2023)
- **Multi-vector attacks are common** — flash loan + price manipulation, reentrancy + reward manipulation
