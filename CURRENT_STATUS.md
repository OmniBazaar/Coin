# OmniCoin Module Current Status

**Last Updated:** 2025-07-26 19:05 UTC
**Current Focus:** Fixing Compilation Errors and Preparing for Testnet Deployment

## Current Work Session Summary

### Session Goal
Ensure the separate, parallel, public/private implementation is coded into all contracts that need it, make it "bullet-proof" and dependable, and thoroughly test all OmniCoin contracts before testnet deployment.

### Recent Activities

1. **Fixed Solhint Errors Across Multiple Contracts**
   - Fixed variable naming convention errors (UPPER_CASE → camelCase) in:
     - OmniCoinStaking.sol: Fixed 4 errors
     - DEXSettlement.sol: Fixed 2 errors  
     - OmniCoinArbitration.sol: Fixed 4 errors
     - OmniCoinBridge.sol: Fixed 2 errors + assembly annotation
     - OmniNFTMarketplace.sol: Fixed 8 errors
   - All contracts now have only warnings, no actual errors from solhint

2. **Fixed Contract Import/Usage Issues**
   - OmniCoinAccount.sol: Changed from OmniCoinCore to OmniCoin import
   - Fixed method calls from privacy-specific to standard ERC20 methods
   - Fixed import statement syntax errors introduced by VS Code

3. **Current Blocking Issue**
   - OmniCoinArbitration.sol compilation error with MpcCore.div
   - Import statements were corrupted by VS Code auto-formatting
   - Fixed imports but compilation still timing out
   - Need to isolate and fix the specific compilation error

4. **Cleanup Completed**
   - Removed test scripts: test-compile-core.js, test-compile.js
   - Removed compile scripts: batch-compile-v2.js, compile-batch.js, compile-single.js
   - Removed extra hardhat configs: batch, single, temp, test
   - Removed test-isolated directory
   - Removed compile.log
   - Cleaned hardhat artifacts and cache

## Technical Status

### Dual-Token Architecture ✅
- **OmniCoin.sol**: Standard ERC20 for public transactions (no encryption)
- **PrivateOmniCoin.sol**: COTI PrivateERC20 for private transactions
- **OmniCoinPrivacyBridge.sol**: Converts between public/private tokens
- Bridge fee: 1-2% (updated from 10% per user guidance)
- Privacy is opt-in, not forced

### Development Environment
- VS Code with Hardhat extension enabled
- Solidity by Juan Blanco extension installed
- Solhint configured for linting (.solhint.json created)
- VS Code settings configured (.vscode/settings.json)

### Compilation Status
- Multiple contracts have solhint warnings but no errors
- OmniCoinArbitration.sol has compilation error (MpcCore.div)
- Full compilation timing out (>2 minutes)
- Need to compile contracts individually to isolate issues

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Fix OmniCoinArbitration.sol compilation error**
   - Verify MpcCore library is properly imported
   - Check div function signature compatibility
   - Consider pragma version consistency

2. **Systematic Compilation Check**
   - Compile each contract individually
   - Document any compilation errors
   - Fix errors one by one

3. **Complete Testing**
   - Write tests for dual-token architecture
   - Test privacy bridge functionality
   - Ensure all contracts integrate properly

## Key Learnings from This Session

1. **VS Code Integration**
   - VS Code can auto-modify import statements
   - Need to be careful with auto-formatting
   - Hardhat extension shows errors inline

2. **Solhint Integration**
   - Successfully configured and used
   - Fixed all severity 8 (error) issues
   - Warnings can be addressed later

3. **Compilation Challenges**
   - Full compilation can timeout
   - Individual contract compilation more effective
   - Import path issues can cause cryptic errors

## Files Modified in This Session

### Contracts Fixed
- OmniCoinStaking.sol
- DEXSettlement.sol
- OmniCoinArbitration.sol
- OmniCoinBridge.sol
- OmniCoinAccount.sol
- OmniNFTMarketplace.sol

### Configuration Added
- .solhint.json
- .vscode/settings.json
- .prettierrc.json (retained)

## Next Session Priority

1. Fix OmniCoinArbitration.sol MpcCore.div compilation error
2. Complete individual contract compilation checks
3. Begin writing comprehensive tests for dual-token architecture
4. Deploy to COTI testnet for validation
