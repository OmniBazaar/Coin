# OmniCoin Module Current Status

**Last Updated:** 2025-07-30 18:07 UTC  
**Current Focus:** Parallel Development - Avalanche Migration + Radical Simplification

## Recent Accomplishments

### Phase 1 Implementation Progress
Successfully completed major Phase 1 updates including:

1. **Token Economics Updates** ✅
   - Updated decimals from 18 to 6 (configurable via DECIMALS constant)
   - Set initial supply to 4,132,353,934 XOM (4.1B)
   - Set max supply to 25,000,000,000 XOM (25B)

2. **Fee Structure Updates** ✅
   - Reduced marketplace fee from 2.5% to 1% with complex distribution
   - Reduced escrow fee from 0.5% to 0.25% with 70/20/10 split
   - Implemented sophisticated fee distribution in OmniUnifiedMarketplace
   - Updated OmniNFTMarketplace to use _distributeFees system

3. **Staking System Enhancements** ✅
   - Implemented 5-tier staking system (5% to 9% APY based on amount)
   - Added duration bonuses (0% to +3% based on commitment period)
   - Updated validator minimum stake to 1,000,000 XOM

4. **Bonus System** ✅
   - Created OmniBonusSystem.sol with tiered bonuses
   - Welcome bonuses: 10,000 down to 625 XOM
   - Referral bonuses: 2,500 down to 156.25 XOM
   - First sale bonuses: 500 down to 31.25 XOM
   - 5-tier structure based on total user count

5. **Block Rewards** ✅
   - Created OmniBlockRewards.sol contract
   - Implements correct distribution order:
     1. Staking rewards calculated and deducted first
     2. 10% of remainder to ODDAO
     3. Rest to block-producing validator
   - Role-based access for block producers and staking pool
   - Separate claim mechanisms for validators, ODDAO, and staking pool
   - Tracks rewards by category

## Current Architecture Direction

### Radical Simplification Initiative (In Progress)
- **Goal:** Remove 80% of on-chain state
- **Strategy:** Move computation to validator network
- **Impact:** 66% less code, 90% less storage, 60% lower gas costs

### Key Architectural Decisions
1. **Event-based architecture** - Remove all on-chain storage arrays
2. **Merkle tree verification** - For off-chain computation validation
3. **Validator state reconstruction** - From events and merkle proofs
4. **Contract consolidation** - Merge from 30+ to 12 core contracts

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Gas-Free Transactions** (Phase 1 Remaining)
   - Implement meta-transaction system
   - Design spam prevention without gas fees
   - Create priority ordering mechanism

2. **Bonus System Integration** (Phase 1 Remaining)
   - Connect OmniBonusSystem to user registration
   - Integrate with marketplace for first sale bonuses
   - Create referral tracking mechanism

3. **State Reduction** (Simplification Week 1)
   - Remove ALL user arrays from contracts
   - Convert ALL historical data to events
   - Design ValidatorOracle for off-chain computation

## Key Design Questions

See PHASE1_DISCUSSION_QUESTIONS.md for detailed questions on:
- Consensus mechanism (PoP with Tendermint BFT)
- Validator limit enforcement (√user count)
- Listing node architecture
- ODDAO governance structure
- Gas-free transaction implementation

## Technical Status

### Recently Modified Contracts
- `OmniCoin.sol` - Token decimals and supply updates
- `OmniUnifiedMarketplace.sol` - Complex fee distribution implementation
- `OmniCoinEscrow.sol` - Fee reduction and distribution
- `OmniCoinStaking.sol` - Duration bonuses implementation
- `OmniNFTMarketplace.sol` - Fee distribution integration

### New Contracts Created
- `OmniBonusSystem.sol` - Complete bonus system
- `OmniBlockRewards.sol` - Block rewards distribution with staking-first logic
- `IOmniCoin.sol` - Interface for minting functionality
- `IOmniCoinStaking.sol` - Interface for staking contract integration

### Documentation Updated
- `PHASE1_UPDATES.md` - Detailed tracking of all changes
- `PHASE1_SUMMARY.md` - High-level summary
- `PHASE1_DISCUSSION_QUESTIONS.md` - Design questions
- `AVALANCHE_SUBNET_ANALYSIS.md` - Initial Avalanche analysis
- `AVALANCHE_MIGRATION_SIMPLIFIED.md` - Simplified migration plan
- `MIGRATION_SEQUENCING_ANALYSIS.md` - Sequencing options analysis
- `PARALLEL_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md` - Week-by-week execution plan

## Dependencies & Blockers

1. **Integration Requirements**
   - ODDAO treasury address needed for fee distribution
   - User registration system needs specification
   - Meta-transaction relayer infrastructure design

2. **Architecture Decisions**
   - Validator oracle specification needed
   - Event indexing service design
   - Merkle proof system implementation

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Goals
- ✅ Reduce all fees to 1% or less
- ✅ Implement tiered staking with bonuses
- ✅ Create bonus distribution system
- ✅ Design block rewards distribution
- ⏳ Enable gas-free transactions
- ⏳ Integrate all systems

### Simplification Goals
- **Before:** 30+ contracts, ~50k storage slots
- **Target:** 12 contracts, ~5k storage slots
- **Expected:** 60% gas reduction, 66% smaller contracts

## Strategic Direction Change

### Parallel Development Approach
Based on analysis, we will pursue **simultaneous** development of:
1. **Radical Simplification** - Moving 80% functionality off-chain
2. **Avalanche Subnet Migration** - For the public chain only

### Key Insight
Privacy features already run as a separate system on COTI and don't need to change:
- PrivateOmniCoin.sol stays on COTI
- COTI continues handling all privacy/MPC
- Only public chain moves to Avalanche
- Bridge continues connecting both

### Timeline: 6 Weeks (Parallel)
- Week 1-2: Foundation (Avalanche setup + array removal)
- Week 3-4: Core development (contract consolidation + validators)
- Week 5-6: Integration and testing

### Benefits of Avalanche Migration
- **Performance**: 1-2 second finality (vs 6 seconds)
- **Scalability**: 4,500+ TPS per subnet
- **Decentralization**: Supports unlimited validators
- **Economics**: Validators already need rewriting
- **Simplicity**: Privacy stays on COTI unchanged

## Development Environment Setup

### Completed
- ✅ Installed Avalanche SDK packages:
  - `@avalabs/avalanchejs@5.0.0` - Core SDK
  - `avalanche@3.16.0` - Legacy support (deprecated)
- ✅ Updated all documentation for parallel development
- ✅ Created comprehensive migration plans

## Next Session Priorities

1. **Study Avalanche architecture deeply** (not just setup)
2. **Begin removing arrays with Avalanche event patterns in mind**
3. **Design event schema optimized for 1-2s blocks**
4. **Start validator prototype using Avalanche SDK**

## Notes

The Phase 1 economic updates are substantially complete. We've made a strategic decision to pursue Avalanche subnet migration in parallel with the simplification initiative. This approach:
- Saves 4-6 weeks vs sequential development
- Avoids throwaway work
- Designs optimal architecture from the start
- Leverages the fact that validators need complete rewrite anyway

The privacy system (PrivateOmniCoin) remains on COTI unchanged, making this migration much simpler than initially thought.
