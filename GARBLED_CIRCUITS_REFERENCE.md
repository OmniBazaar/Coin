# Garbled Circuits Technology Reference

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive technical reference for garbled circuits technology as implemented in COTI V2, serving as a development guide for the OmniCoin privacy features. Garbled circuits are the core privacy technology used throughout the OmniBazaar ecosystem, not zero-knowledge proofs.

## What Are Garbled Circuits?

Garbled circuits are a cryptographic protocol from the field of secure multi-party computation (MPC) that enables two or more parties to jointly compute a function over their private inputs while keeping those inputs completely private from each other throughout the entire computation process.

Originally developed in the 1980s by Andrew Yao to solve the "Millionaire's Problem" (determining who is wealthier without revealing actual wealth), garbled circuits have evolved into a cornerstone technology for privacy-preserving computation.

## Technical Mechanism

### Function Representation
1. **Boolean Circuit Construction**: Any mathematical function is first translated into a Boolean circuit consisting of basic logical gates (AND, OR, NOT, XOR)
2. **Gate-Level Operations**: The circuit processes binary inputs through these fundamental operations
3. **Deterministic Computation**: The circuit produces predictable outputs for given inputs

### Circuit Garbling Process
1. **Encryption of Logic**: The "garbler" (typically one party) encrypts the entire circuit, including:
   - Individual logic gates
   - Input wires
   - Output wires
   - Intermediate connections

2. **Key Generation**: Each input and output wire is assigned cryptographic keys
3. **Truth Table Encryption**: Each gate's truth table is encrypted using the wire keys
4. **Obfuscation**: The circuit structure becomes incomprehensible to external observers

### Circuit Evaluation
1. **Oblivious Transfer (OT)**: Parties securely exchange evaluation keys without revealing their actual inputs
2. **Encrypted Computation**: The evaluator processes the garbled circuit using their encrypted inputs
3. **Private Execution**: All intermediate values remain encrypted throughout computation
4. **Result Decryption**: Only the final output is decryptable by authorized parties

## Smart Contract Integration

### COTI V2 Private Data Types

```solidity
// Basic private data types in COTI V2
ctUint64 private balance;      // Private 64-bit unsigned integer
ctBool private condition;      // Private boolean
ctAddress private recipient;   // Private address

// Operations on private data
function privateTransfer(ctAddress to, ctUint64 amount) external {
    balance = balance.sub(amount);
    // Transfer logic with garbled circuit computation
}
```

### Privacy Patterns

#### 1. Private State Variables

```solidity
contract PrivateToken {
    mapping(address => ctUint256) private balances;
    
    function getBalance(address account) external view returns (ctUint256) {
        // Returns encrypted balance, only account owner can decrypt
        return balances[account];
    }
}
```

#### 2. Multi-party Computations

```solidity
contract PrivateAuction {
    function submitBid(ctUint256 bidAmount) external {
        // Multiple parties can participate in auction
        // Winning bid determined without revealing amounts
        processBidWithGarbledCircuit(msg.sender, bidAmount);
    }
}
```

#### 3. Conditional Privacy

```solidity
contract ConditionalTransfer {
    function conditionalPay(
        ctAddress recipient,
        ctUint256 amount,
        ctBool condition
    ) external {
        // Payment occurs only if condition is met
        // Condition evaluation remains private
        executeIfCondition(recipient, amount, condition);
    }
}
```
