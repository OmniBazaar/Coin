# OmniCoinEscrowV2 Privacy Logic Update

**Date:** 2025-07-26 07:54 UTC  
**Status:** COMPLETED âœ…

## Summary

Successfully updated OmniCoinEscrowV2.sol to implement the proper privacy logic pattern where:
- **Default**: Public escrow operations (no privacy fees)
- **Optional**: Private escrow operations (10x fees via PrivacyFeeManager)

## Key Changes

### 1. Added Privacy Fee Configuration
```solidity
uint256 public constant PRIVACY_MULTIPLIER = 10; // 10x fee for privacy
address public privacyFeeManager;
```

### 2. Updated Constructor
```solidity
constructor(address _token, address _admin, address _privacyFeeManager)
```

### 3. Created Dual Functions

#### Public Functions (Default - No Privacy Fees):
- `createEscrow()` - Standard escrow creation
- `releaseEscrow()` - Standard release
- `createDispute()` - Standard dispute
- `resolveDispute()` - Standard resolution

#### Privacy Functions (Optional - Premium Fees):
- `createEscrowWithPrivacy()` - Private escrow with encrypted amounts
- `releaseEscrowWithPrivacy()` - Private release operation
- `createDisputeWithPrivacy()` - Private dispute with encrypted reason
- `resolveDisputeWithPrivacy()` - Private resolution with encrypted splits

### 4. Fixed Token Transfer Methods
Changed from non-existent `transfer()` to:
- `transferPublic()` for public operations
- `transferFromPublic()` for public allowance-based transfers
- `transferGarbled()` for private operations (with MPC)

### 5. Privacy Fee Collection
Each privacy function collects fees via PrivacyFeeManager:
```solidity
PrivacyFeeManager(privacyFeeManager).collectPrivacyFee(
    msg.sender,
    keccak256("OPERATION_TYPE"),
    privacyFee
);
```

## Operation Types for Fee Collection
- `ESCROW_CREATE` - Creating private escrow
- `ESCROW_RELEASE` - Releasing with privacy
- `ESCROW_DISPUTE` - Creating private dispute
- `DISPUTE_RESOLUTION` - Resolving with privacy

## Next Steps
1. Create tests for the new privacy functions
2. Apply similar pattern to OmniCoinPaymentV2.sol
3. Continue with other contracts requiring privacy logic

## Architecture Note
This implementation aligns with the hybrid storage strategy where:
- Critical escrow states remain on-chain (COTI)
- Privacy is an opt-in premium feature
- Users always have the choice between public (cheap) and private (premium) operations
