# OmniCoinPaymentV2 Privacy Logic Update

**Date:** 2025-07-26 08:10 UTC  
**Status:** COMPLETED âœ…

## Summary

Successfully updated OmniCoinPaymentV2.sol to implement the proper privacy logic pattern where:
- **Default**: Public payment operations (no privacy fees)
- **Optional**: Private payment operations (10x fees via PrivacyFeeManager)

## Key Changes

### 1. Added Privacy Fee Configuration
```solidity
uint256 public constant PRIVACY_MULTIPLIER = 10; // 10x fee for privacy
address public privacyFeeManager;
```

### 2. Updated Constructor
```solidity
constructor(
    address _token,
    address _accountContract,
    address _stakingContract,
    address _admin,
    address _privacyFeeManager
)
```

### 3. Created Dual Functions

#### Public Functions (Default - No Privacy Fees):
- `processPayment()` - Standard payment processing
- `createPaymentStream()` - Standard payment streaming

#### Privacy Functions (Optional - Premium Fees):
- `processPaymentWithPrivacy()` - Private payments with encrypted amounts
- `createPaymentStreamWithPrivacy()` - Private payment streams

### 4. Fixed Token Transfer Methods
Changed to use OmniCoinCore's actual methods:
- `transferFromPublic()` for public operations
- `transferFrom()` (returns gtBool) for private operations

### 5. Privacy Fee Collection
Each privacy function collects fees via PrivacyFeeManager:
```solidity
PrivacyFeeManager(privacyFeeManager).collectPrivacyFee(
    msg.sender,
    keccak256("OPERATION_TYPE"),
    privacyFee
);
```

## Operation Types for Fee Collection
- `PAYMENT_PROCESS` - Processing private payments
- `STREAM_CREATE` - Creating private payment streams

## Key Pattern Applied
```solidity
function operationWithPrivacy(...params, bool usePrivacy) {
    require(usePrivacy && isMpcAvailable, "Privacy not available");
    require(privacyFeeManager != address(0), "Privacy fee manager not set");
    
    // Collect privacy fee (10x normal fee)
    uint256 privacyFee = normalFee * PRIVACY_MULTIPLIER;
    PrivacyFeeManager(privacyFeeManager).collectPrivacyFee(...);
    
    // Private logic using MPC...
}
```

## Features Preserved
- Instant payments with optional staking
- Payment streaming over time
- Batch payment support (in internal functions)
- Integration with staking rewards

## Next Steps
1. Create tests for the new privacy functions
2. Apply similar pattern to OmniCoinStakingV2.sol
3. Continue with other contracts requiring privacy logic

## Architecture Note
This implementation continues the pattern where:
- Users choose between public (cheap) and private (premium) operations
- Privacy is never forced - always opt-in
- All fees collected in OMNI, conversion to COTI handled by PrivacyFeeManager
