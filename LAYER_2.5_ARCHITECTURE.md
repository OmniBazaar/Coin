# OmniCoin Layer 2.5 Architecture

## Executive Summary

OmniCoin is NOT a simple token on COTI. It is a complete Layer 2.5 blockchain solution with:
- Its own validator network processing ALL transactions
- Its own consensus mechanism (DPoS)
- Periodic checkpoints to COTI for security
- Optional privacy features via COTI MPC bridge

## Architecture Components

### 1. OmniCoin Blockchain (Primary Layer)
**Location**: Independent validator network
**Components**:
- Full blockchain with blocks, transactions, state
- All smart contracts (marketplace, escrow, payments, etc.)
- Validator nodes running OmniCoin software
- Complete transaction processing and finality

**User Experience**:
- Users interact ONLY with OmniCoin network
- Pay fees in OmniCoins
- No COTI tokens needed
- Instant transaction finality

### 2. COTI Integration (Security Layer)
**Location**: COTI V2 blockchain
**Components**:
- State commitment contract (stores periodic roots)
- Rollup verifier (validates state transitions)
- Bridge contracts (OMNI â†” COTI transfers)
- MPC interface (privacy computations)

**Purpose**:
- Inherit COTI's security guarantees
- Enable cross-chain asset transfers
- Access MPC privacy features when needed
- Provide decentralized checkpoint verification

## Transaction Flow

### Standard OmniCoin Transaction
1. User signs transaction with OmniCoin wallet
2. Transaction sent to OmniCoin validator network
3. Validators process and include in OmniCoin block
4. Instant finality within OmniCoin network
5. User pays fee in OmniCoins to validators

### Checkpoint Process (Every 1-24 hours)
1. Validators compute merkle root of OmniCoin state
2. Selected validator submits root to COTI contract
3. COTI contract stores checkpoint for security
4. Other chains/bridges can verify OmniCoin state
5. Cost: ~20-50 COTI paid from validator treasury

### Privacy-Enhanced Transaction (Optional)
1. User requests private computation via OmniCoin
2. OmniCoin validators queue request to MPC bridge
3. COTI MPC processes private computation
4. Result returned to OmniCoin network
5. User pays premium fee in OmniCoins

## Economic Model

### Validator Revenue (ALL in OmniCoins)
- Transaction fees: 0.01-0.1 OMNI per tx
- Marketplace fees: 0.1-1% of sales
- Escrow fees: 0.5% of escrow value
- Staking rewards: From inflation
- Bridge fees: For cross-chain transfers

### Validator Costs
- Infrastructure: Servers, bandwidth
- COTI checkpoints: ~120-500 COTI/day
- Paid from treasury (20% of fees)

### User Costs
- ALL fees paid in OmniCoins
- No COTI needed for users
- Competitive with other L2 solutions
- Transparent fee structure

## Deployment Strategy

### Phase 1: OmniCoin Network
1. Deploy validator software
2. Launch OmniCoin blockchain
3. Deploy all smart contracts
4. Test with OmniCoin-only transactions

### Phase 2: COTI Integration
1. Deploy minimal contracts to COTI:
   - OmniCoinStateCommitment.sol
   - OmniCoinRollupVerifier.sol
   - OmniCoinBridge.sol
   - OmniCoinMPCInterface.sol
2. Test checkpoint submissions
3. Verify bridge operations

### Phase 3: Production
1. Launch with 50-100 validators
2. Enable checkpoints every 4 hours
3. Open bridge for liquidity
4. Scale based on usage

## Key Differences from Simple Token

| Feature | Simple Token | OmniCoin Layer 2.5 |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|
| Transaction Processing | COTI validators | OmniCoin validators |
| User Fees | Paid in COTI | Paid in OmniCoins |
| Transaction Speed | COTI block time | Instant (1-3 seconds) |
| Scalability | Limited by COTI | Unlimited |
| Privacy | Always uses MPC | Optional MPC |
| Validator Rewards | COTI tokens | OmniCoins |
| Infrastructure | None needed | Full validator network |

## Technical Implementation

### OmniCoin Validator Node
- Modified Ethereum/Polygon node software
- DPoS consensus mechanism
- State management and storage
- P2P networking layer
- JSON-RPC API compatibility

### Smart Contract Deployment
- ALL contracts deployed on OmniCoin network
- Use existing Ethereum tooling (Hardhat, etc.)
- No modifications needed for MPC in most cases
- Optional MPC bridge for privacy features

### Checkpoint Mechanism
```javascript
// Simplified checkpoint process
async function submitCheckpoint() {
    // 1. Compute state root on OmniCoin
    const stateRoot = await computeStateRoot();
    
    // 2. Get validator signatures
    const signatures = await collectValidatorSignatures(stateRoot);
    
    // 3. Submit to COTI contract
    const tx = await cotiContract.submitStateRoot(
        stateRoot,
        blockNumber,
        signatures
    );
    
    // 4. Pay from validator treasury
    // Cost: ~20-50 COTI
}
```

## Benefits of This Architecture

1. **True Decentralization**: Own validator network, not dependent on COTI
2. **User Simplicity**: Only need OmniCoins, familiar Web3 experience
3. **Scalability**: Process millions of TPS without COTI limits
4. **Cost Efficiency**: Minimal COTI usage (< $50/day at scale)
5. **Flexibility**: Can upgrade independently of COTI
6. **Security**: Inherits COTI security via checkpoints
7. **Privacy Options**: Access MPC when needed, not forced

## Conclusion

OmniCoin as a Layer 2.5 solution provides the perfect balance:
- Independence and control of our own blockchain
- Security guarantees from COTI checkpoints
- Optional privacy features via MPC bridge
- Sustainable economics with OmniCoin-based fees
- Seamless user experience without COTI complexity

This is NOT just another token on COTI - it's a complete blockchain ecosystem that strategically uses COTI for security and privacy enhancement.
