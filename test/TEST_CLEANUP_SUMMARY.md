# Test Directory Cleanup Summary

## Date: 2025-08-02

## Overview
Cleaned up Coin test directory to match the simplified architecture with only 7 remaining contracts.

## Actions Taken

### 1. Created Comprehensive Test Suites
Created new test files for all 7 remaining contracts:
- `MinimalEscrow.test.js` - Tests for 2-of-3 multisig escrow with commit-reveal arbitration
- `OmniCore.test.js` - Tests for service registry, validator management, and merkle root updates
- `OmniGovernance.test.js` - Tests for on-chain voting and proposal execution
- `OmniMarketplace.test.js` - Tests for minimal listing management and fee handling
- `OmniBridge.test.js` - Tests for Avalanche Warp Messaging cross-chain transfers
- `OmniCoin.test.js` - Updated for new simplified token architecture (18 decimals)
- `PrivateOmniCoin.test.js` - Updated for privacy token with 18 decimals

### 2. Moved Deprecated Tests
Created `/test/deprecated/` directory and moved 40+ test files that reference removed contracts:
- `DualTokenIntegration.test.js`
- `OmniCoinArbitration.test.js` 
- `OmniCoinBridge.test.js` (old version)
- `DualTokenArchitecture.test.js`
- All files in `/test/privacy/`
- All files in `/test/security/`
- All files in `/test/integration/`

### 3. Updated Test Runner
Updated `runAllTests.js` to only reference the 7 active test files in 3 categories:
- Core Contracts: OmniCoin, PrivateOmniCoin, OmniCore
- Business Logic: MinimalEscrow, OmniMarketplace, OmniGovernance
- Cross-Chain: OmniBridge

### 4. Key Changes in Tests
- All amounts now use 18 decimals (ethers.parseEther)
- Removed references to deprecated contracts (Reputation, Staking, Validator, etc.)
- Tests focus on minimal on-chain functionality
- Privacy tests acknowledge COTI MPC requirements
