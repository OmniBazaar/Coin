# OmniCoin Smart Contract Development Plan

**Last Updated:** 2025-07-26 07:45 UTC

## Overview

OmniCoin is being migrated from the Graphene blockchain to a new smart contract-based implementation on the COTI V2 platform. This implementation specifically leverages COTI V2's privacy features and integrates with all OmniBazaar components.

This document outlines the development plan, testing strategy, and implementation details.

## CRITICAL UPDATE: COTI V2 Native Feature Integration (2025-07-23)

### Discovered COTI V2 Native Features to Leverage

After reviewing COTI V2 documentation and SDK, we've identified that OmniBazaar is currently reimplementing several features that COTI V2 already provides natively. This presents an opportunity to reduce complexity and improve security by leveraging battle-tested COTI implementations.

#### Native COTI V2 Features Currently Being Underutilized

1. **Reputation System** - COTI has native reputation mechanisms we should use instead of `OmniCoinReputation.sol`
2. **Arbitration** - COTI provides native dispute resolution we should leverage instead of `OmniCoinArbitration.sol`
3. **Governance** - COTI has native governance features to replace our custom `OmniCoinGovernor.sol`
4. **Treasury** - COTI's native treasury can handle fee distribution instead of custom implementation
5. **Cross-Chain Bridge** - COTI may have native cross-chain capabilities to explore

#### Currently Well-Utilized COTI V2 Features

1. **Privacy Layer (Garbled Circuits/MPC)** - We're correctly using COTI's privacy features
2. **MPC Precompile** - Leveraging native blockchain precompile at address `0x64`
3. **Encrypted Types** - Using `ctUint64`, `gtUint64`, `itUint64` for private operations
4. **Private ERC20** - Implementing confidential transfers with COTI's PrivateERC20

### Updated Architecture: Hybrid L2.5 Implementation

Based on our analysis, OmniCoin operates as:
- **Layer 2.5 blockchain** with its own validators processing public transactions
- **Optional privacy** via COTI MPC for users who pay premium fees (10-50x standard)
- **Fee abstraction** - users always pay in OMNI, we handle COTI conversion
- **Public by default** - privacy is opt-in, not mandatory
- **All contracts default to `isMpcAvailable = false`** for production use

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL UPDATE: Privacy Logic Pattern (2025-01-27)

### Issue Discovered:
User identified critical flaw: Setting `isMpcAvailable = false` on COTI would disable existing MPC functionality.

### Solution Implemented:
**Separate technical capability from business logic:**
- `isMpcAvailable`: Whether MPC is technically available (true on COTI, false in Hardhat)
- `privacyEnabledByDefault`: Business decision (always false - privacy is opt-in)
- New functions: `transferWithPrivacy()`, `transferFromWithPrivacy()`, etc.

### Pattern to Apply to ALL Contracts:
```solidity
// OLD (WRONG):
if (isMpcAvailable) {
    // Always use privacy when MPC is available
}

// NEW (CORRECT):
function doSomethingWithPrivacy(params, bool usePrivacy) {
    if (usePrivacy && isMpcAvailable) {
        // User explicitly chose privacy
        require(privacyFeeManager != address(0), "Privacy fee manager not set");
        IPrivacyFeeManager(privacyFeeManager).collectPrivacyFee(
            msg.sender,
            keccak256("OPERATION_TYPE"),
            amount
        );
        // Use MPC for private operation
    } else {
        // Standard public operation (default)
    }
}
```

## ðŸš¨ PLATFORM DECISION UPDATE (2025-07-26)

### Decision: STAY WITH COTI
After thorough analysis, we're staying with COTI for its unique MPC privacy capabilities. Migration to Polygon would require 6-10 months and lose 80% of our privacy features.

### Immediate Optimization Priorities:
1. **Convert all storage to events** - 90% cost reduction
2. **Implement batch processing** - Single tx for multiple operations  
3. **Move evaluator logic to validators** - Off-chain computation
4. **Use state commitments** - Only merkle roots on-chain

See `COTI_TO_POLYGON_MIGRATION_ANALYSIS.md` for full analysis.
