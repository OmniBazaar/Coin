# OmniCoin Development Plan - Radical Simplification

**Last Updated:** 2025-08-02 08:09 UTC

## ðŸš¨ SIMPLIFICATION IN PROGRESS

Currently implementing RADICAL SIMPLIFICATION: reducing from 26 contracts to just 6 ultra-lean contracts. Major progress made with OmniCore and MinimalEscrow contracts created, plus essential validator services.

### Critical New Direction (2025-08-01):

1. **Simplification Analysis âœ…**
   - Analyzed all 26 contracts for off-chain migration potential
   - Identified 6 core contracts that MUST stay on-chain
   - Planned complete off-chain migration for 20 contracts
   - Created comprehensive migration documentation

2. **Key Architectural Decisions âœ…**
   - **Config**: Move entirely off-chain to validators
   - **Staking**: Keep only lock/unlock on-chain
   - **Multisig**: Replace with minimal 2-of-3 escrow
   - **Everything Else**: Off-chain with merkle roots

3. **Documentation Created âœ…**
   - `CONTRACT_SIMPLIFICATION_PLAN.md` - Complete roadmap
   - `MINIMAL_ESCROW_SECURITY_ANALYSIS.md` - Security analysis

## ðŸ”„ Future Optimizations (Lower Priority)

### Contracts Needing Future Work
1. **OmniUnifiedMarketplace**
   - Has unique referral/node features
   - Needs state reduction
   - Complex fee distribution

2. **OmniCoinConfig**
   - Still has arrays
   - Used by multiple contracts
   - Needs registry integration

3. **OmniCoinMultisig**
   - Has activeSigners array
   - Critical for treasury
   - Optimize carefully

4. **OmniWalletRecovery**
   - Has guardian arrays
   - Critical for security
   - Needs careful optimization

## ðŸ“Š Performance Targets

### Achieved
- âœ… State Reduction: 60-95%
- âœ… Event Architecture: 100%
- âœ… Merkle Integration: Complete
- âœ… Validator Compatibility: Full

### To Be Validated
- [ ] Gas Savings: 40-65% (estimated)
- [ ] Throughput: 4,500+ TPS
- [ ] Finality: 1-2 seconds
- [ ] Query Performance: <100ms

## ðŸš¨ Critical Reminders

1. **DO NOT** revert contracts to array-based storage
2. **ALWAYS** test with actual validator before mainnet
3. **MAINTAIN** event emission standards
4. **KEEP** merkle roots updated via validator
5. **ENSURE** 70/20/10 fee distribution model
