# OmniCoin State Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes OmniCoin contracts to identify opportunities for state reduction or relocation. The analysis categorizes state variables into four groups:
1. **MUST remain in contract** - Core protocol state (e.g., token balances)
2. **Could move to validator network** - Temporary or computational state
3. **Could move to another contract** - Configuration or registry data
4. **Could be eliminated** - Caches or redundant data

### Contracts to Keep Stateful

- **OmniCoinValidator.sol**: Core consensus contract
- **OmniCoinGovernor.sol**: Governance security critical

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Phase 1**: Move configuration values to registry pattern
2. **Phase 2**: Implement event-based history tracking
3. **Phase 3**: Deploy off-chain computation infrastructure
4. **Phase 4**: Implement merkle proof systems for aggregated data
5. **Phase 5**: Migrate historical data to off-chain storage

## Risk Assessment

### Security Risks
- **Data Availability**: Requires reliable event indexing infrastructure
- **Validator Trust**: Off-chain computation requires validator consensus
- **Proof Verification**: Merkle proofs add complexity

### Mitigation Strategies
- Implement multiple independent indexers
- Use threshold signatures for validator data
- Extensive testing of proof verification
- Gradual rollout with fallback mechanisms

## Conclusion

The analysis identifies significant opportunities to reduce on-chain state while maintaining security. Priority should be given to contracts with the highest storage costs and lowest security requirements for on-chain state. The recommended changes could reduce overall storage costs by 40-60% while maintaining the security guarantees of the protocol.
